# first version
- investigate and fix duplex memory leaks


# later
- add proper logging layer to apiMiddlewares
- implement decycle
- better errors
- improve not found property


# done
+ support arrays (not only tuples) as function args (e.g. (...args) => number)
+ add optional logging to api servers and proxies
+ fix rest mock server + firstJsArg
+ use func helpers instead of long chain access
+ encode binary in JSON
+ encoder -> codec
+ move ext/basic-types to /types/ext
+ type.setMocker -> setMocker(type)
+ binary encoding
+ callbacks
+ not serializing literals probably will lead to missing information in oneOf. E.g. {type: 'a' (leteral), value: 1} vs. {type: 'b' (literal), value: 2}
+ guard callbacks
+ write binary msg-codec

# won't fix?
- don't mutate in setEncoder, setValidator etc. ??? (it does not work as types are created inside other types)
    e.g. genericNumber(() => t.number) <- here t.number is created from inside and refers to unextended type (if immutable)
